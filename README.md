# RIFT Renderer
Just a personal toolbox for rendering experiments.  Originally started as an implementation of Peter Shirley's "Raytracing in One Weekend", because why not?

Name is an acronym for "Reduction in Free Time".

With no plugins it compiles with all major compilers: VC++, GCC and Clang.  Clang seems to be the fastest.  

With plugins enabled, only VC++ is supported at this time (cause that's the only one I built dependencies for).

Includes headers from the STB image library: https://github.com/nothings/stb

Current (optional) plugins and versions:

* Boost - 1.66
* OpenImageIO - 2.0.6
* OpenEXR - 2.2.0
* ILMBase - 2.2.0
* LibPNG - 1.6.12
* LibJPEG-Turbo - 1.3.1
* LibTIFF - 4.0.3
