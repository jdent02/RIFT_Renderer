# FARTS_Renderer
Just a personal toolbox for rendering experiments.  Originally started as an implementation of Peter Shirley's "Raytracing in One Weekend", because why not?

Name is an acronym for "F**k, another random time sink".

Compiles with all major compilers: VC++, GCC and Clang.  Clang seems to be the fastest.

Requires the STB image library (declared with -DSTB_LIB in CMake): https://github.com/nothings/stb
